Language Processing and Software
--------------------------------
1) For the python recognizer needs a stricter confidence for start command.
2) Might need to remove connection because it disturbs flow of application.
2.1) Exit the application for downstreams and allow the python app to start again upon user's request.  (JUST NEED TO TEST)
3) The following can be handled by ChatGPT, PalM or IBM Watson Large Text Generative Transformers.
    * Translate utility.
    * Alternative to free ChatGPT..Explore PALM API.
4) Check out this news implementation as inpiration to better implement current news. https://github.com/KwabenBerko/News-API-Java
5) Havent been testing :( Needs to be done ASAP! 
6) Stocks and Finance?? Optional...

Hardware and Face Detection
---------------------------
1) Javascript and HTML to show the face and tracking **
2) Face Detection to control the face. 
3) Startup message and Logo. Also display information for user input and oswel output.
4) Integrate software to Raspberry PI.
5) LCD for the raspberry pi.

Documentation
-------------
0) Provide examples in the ReadMe of what it can do, what you can ask, etc.
1) Write a paper on the concept of Oswel and how different systems are managed and distributed to form the overall design. 
2) Complete Readme.md, add hardware instructions and setup
3) PDF to show instructions and system design. 
3) Research ECAs

Purposes
--------
Java Application does the main language processes. 
Python Application handles startups and Vision Outputs. 
A python application that can handle running the JAR file for the main NLP app, but also shows stability in running endlessly. Also should be able to run object detection.
