Language Processing and Software
--------------------------------
----Checkpoint----
2) Set a longer timeout to write for Raspberry PI to handle fix this issue?
3) The following can be handled by ChatGPT, PalM or IBM Watson Large Text Generative Transformers.
    * Translate utility.
    * Alternative to free ChatGPT..Explore PALM API.
4) Check out this news implementation as inpiration to better implement current news. https://github.com/KwabenBerko/News-API-Java
5) Speech recognition in Java is timed out?
6) Havent been testing :( Needs to be done ASAP!
7) Refactor Speech implementation to remove saving MP3 files and directly speaking the audio. 
8) Stocks and Finance?? Optional...

2) Need a better method to parse the string via Serial such as detecting input, repetition of strings, and for departure to reset input to None.
3) ESP32 Startup message and Logo
4) Face Detection to control the face. 
5) Start Up Keyword maybe in python using edgetts

Documentation
-------------
1) Write a paper on the concept of Oswel and how different systems are managed and distributed to form the overall design. 
2) Complete Readme.md, add hardware instructions and setup
3) Research ECAs
