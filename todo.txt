1) Need a lot of cleaning in the code, do we really need Month.java and WeekDay.java??
1.1) Make sure external references to sources are provided in the source code.
1.2) Check out this news implementation as inpiration to better implement current news. https://github.com/KwabenBerko/News-API-Java
2) Is there no POM endpoints for MaryTTS and Guava?
3) Logger in Java instead of print statements.
4) Face Detection in JAVA
The following can be handled by ChatGPT.
5) Any given sentence, the most important noun to be searched in wikipedia?
6) Translate utility.
7) Alternative to free ChatGPT..Explore PALM API.

8) Speech recognition in Java is timed out?
9) Stocks?? Optional...
10) Maybe retrain a better model, also should be able to handle responses to user responding to how they are feeling such as "I am doing well".
Also should have some confirmation responses. 

14) License file or perhaps another file called info.json should contain the following information file names
							"oswel.h5",
							"words.txt",
							"classes.txt",
							"intents.json"
Also should contain the current location by default? such as Calgary. Also contains the API endpoints?

Overall functionality is to recognize speech and deliver meaningful responses...
Next steps is to integrate to Raspberry PI and develop the OLED display and Firebeetle Microcontroller to output the Oswel Logo and information to be displayed. 

Any other non categories should be confirmation responses examples:
Check,
Will do,
As you wish,

Otherwise ChatGPT is prompted.
